## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests with watch mode
npm run test:run     # Run tests once
npm run lint         # Lint and fix code
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run validate     # Run all quality checks
```

## Key Components Architecture

- **Components**: Located in `/src/components/ui/` with comprehensive prop interfaces
- **Testing**: Organized in `/__tests__/` directory mirroring source structure
- **Theming**: CSS variables-based system in `/src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- **API**: Enhanced client with caching in `/src/lib/api.ts`
- **State**: Zustand stores in `/src/store/` directory
- **Types**: TypeScript definitions in `/src/types/`

## Usage Patterns

- All components support variants, sizes, and validation states
- Accessibility is built-in with proper ARIA attributes
- Theme switching uses CSS variables for seamless transitions
- API calls include automatic caching and error handling
- Forms integrate with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- Tests cover component functionality and accessibility

This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for professional React development with modern tools and best practices.
